paragraph avantgarde (12) "This is a paragraph using the default from previous
(i.e., justified).
It's a nice long paragraph to test how things work,
but really doesn't say anything very useful, since
I just want to ramble on and on for a while to make it long.
Or as the \f(TI)Monty Python\f(PV) sketch said so succintly, \"Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah....\"
After all, no one expects the Spanish Inquisition.
But enough of this nonsense. Now for something completely different:

ragged paragraph newcentury bold (16) "This is a ragged paragraph.
Apart from that, and the fact that its left and right margins have
been altered, it is as uninteresting as the previous paragraph.
It just rambles on for a while so that it will take up several lines."

Not to mention that now is the time for all good men to come to the
