paragraph (14) "This file tests cases that were originally coded to be
fatal errors, but then were relaxed to be just warnings.
For each such case, first an input was contrived to cause
the error, then code was changed to make it into a warning,
and then this file was used to verify it had indeed been reduced
to a warning, and did not have bad side effects. You can verify the
warnings are silenced entirely by using -DNOWARNINGS"
